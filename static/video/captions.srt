00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Most people only pay attention to the final product or the success of an entrepreneur.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
They say things like I can never be like them when they got lucky.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But what most people don't see is what they had to overcome.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
All the struggles, the daily rejections, the heartaches, the betrayals, the rumours, the criticism, the empty bank account,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
those lonely nights trying to make a visionary reality.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The only difference between the one who quit and the one who didn't quit is that the one who made it showed up every day.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
They worked hard every day, they hustled every day, they improved every day.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
They did all this even though they thought of quitting every day.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And eventually they became who they are today.
